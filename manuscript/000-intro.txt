# Introduction 

Welcome to Make JavaScript Games. Our Engineering-Writers have built some of their favourite games using Replit's KaboomJS framework.

The main writers for most of the chapters were Bradley Van Aardt and David Yates.

The projects we have chosen present a great way to learn programming if you're brand new to it, or to learn game development if you already have basic coding skills.

If you're a seasoned expert, they form a good introduction to KaboomJS.

I hope you'll have fun building these games yourself and extending them with your own features.

This is our first physical book, so if you have any feedback please send it to me directly at gareth@ritza.co. Compliments and criticisms are equally welcome.
